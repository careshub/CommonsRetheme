JS files ==================

The files in /src and /libs are concatenated and minified into commons.min.js, which is the file that is enqueued in the theme and loaded on every page.

Files in /libs are external libraries that we use but do not modify for use.

Files in /src are files that we created and modify.

navigation.min.js is created for Yan's use on maps and assessments subdomains.
